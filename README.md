RCLog
=====

This is a replacement of the NSLog in objective-c. The informations NSLog outputs are not really useful, RCLog outputs the filename and line number where the log occurred. It comes with some other great shortcuts as well and you can see them in the samples beneath:

	RCLog(fmt, ... ); // A replacement for NSLog

	RCLogO(obj); // Logs an object directly, no need for the hard to write NSLog(@"%@", obj)
	RCLogS(str); // Logs a string
	RCLogI(integer); // Integer
	RCLogF(float); // Float
	RCLogRect(rect); // Ever wanted to log a CGRect. Boring, use this shortcut
	RCLogPoint(point); // CGPoint
	RCLogSize(size); // Size
	RCLogThread(); //  This logs the thread you are into
	
The possibilities are endless, please contribute if you have an idea. For the near future is planned to add a blank line between logs from different classes, this will make the reading even easier.


Usage
=====

Add the RCLog classes to your project then import it once in the .pch file

	#import "RCLog.h"
